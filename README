PREREQUISITES
=============
You need OpenSSL at least 0.9.7 OR cryptlib 3.1 or later.

HOW
===
Copy Makefile.proto to Makefile and edit it according to instructions found
there.

USAGE
=====
Read the secpwgen man page.

NOTE ON VERSIONING
==================
Unlike many open-source packages, this program's versioning follows the
normal DECIMAL NUMBER comparison rules: the following example shows the
ordering of versions: 0.9 < 1.0 < 1.1 < 1.2 < 1.21 < 1.22xx < 1.3 (some
time in the future) because the same relations hold for ordinary decimals.

TODO
====
Add an option to specify path to EGD socket. This will enable the program to
provide secure passwords even on crippled systems (with no /dev/{u,}random)
provided EGD (entropy gathering daemon) is running.

Call OpenSSL Win32 specific function to init the entropy pool.
